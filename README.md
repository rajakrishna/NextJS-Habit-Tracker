# Habit Tracker using NextJs, Apollo, GraphQL and MongoDB

NextJS is a JavaScript Framework for React that allows you to Server-Side Render React

![habit_tracker_img](https://github.com/rajakrishna/NextJS-Habit-Tracker/blob/master/files/habit_tracker.png)

## Pros of NextJS

Server side rendering

Next JS routing system is all based on pages directory

Using NextJS Apollo with GraphQL

No need to `import React from "react"`. Babel will automatically import react. next/babel has preset-react which import react.

It even imports typescript

It prefetchs the links. Prefetch is true by default.

Dynamic routing is very useful by using [route_name] as the file name

## Cons of NextJS

`styled-jsx` is weird to use

Cannot use nested styled components

NextJS caches everything. So you need to delete the .next folder if you make any changes to the schema
